# Shivani Karumuri â€“ Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It highlights my skills, projects, certifications, and contact details. The website is responsive and includes visual elements like videos and images to make it more engaging.

Thanks for the clarification, Shivani! The issue is happening because you're placing triple backticks (\`\`\`) **inside list items** and **not formatting them cleanly**. To make all boxes appear **dark (black) with white text** like step 1, you must **not indent the backticks**.

Here is your **corrected Installation section** with all steps styled the same way (black box with white text):

---

````markdown
## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Build Portfolio from the source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Karumuri-shivani/Portfolio
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

```bash
cd Portfolio
```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

```bash
npm install
```

```

âœ… Paste this **exactly as it is** into your `README.md` and all three steps will appear in **individual black boxes with white text**, just like your step 1.

Would you like me to format the **Usage** and **Testing** sections the same way too?
```






### ðŸ”§ Optional:
- Replace `{test_framework}` with whatever youâ€™re using (like Jest or Mocha).
- You can also add a Live Demo link or Screenshots section if you want.

Would you like me to generate the **badges for a "Live Demo" link** too?
```
