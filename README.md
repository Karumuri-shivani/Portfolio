# Shivani Karumuri â€“ Portfolio Website

This is the source code for my personal portfolio website. It highlights my skills, projects, certifications, and contact details. The website is responsive and includes visual elements like videos and images to make it more engaging.


## ðŸ“¦ Installation

Build Portfolio from the source and install dependencies:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Karumuri-shivani/Portfolio
````

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd Portfolio
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   Using **npm**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## ðŸš€ Usage

Run the project with:

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm start
```

## âœ… Testing

Portfolio uses the `{test_framework}` test framework. Run the test suite with:

Using **npm**:

```bash
npm test
```


### ðŸ”§ Optional:
- Replace `{test_framework}` with whatever youâ€™re using (like Jest or Mocha).
- You can also add a Live Demo link or Screenshots section if you want.

Would you like me to generate the **badges for a "Live Demo" link** too?
